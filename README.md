## 🛠 Tech Stack & Rationale

### **Next.js (React Framework)**
- **SEO & Performance**: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) improve load times and search engine visibility.
- **Built-in Routing**: Eliminates the need for extra routing libraries, reducing complexity.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for projects that may later integrate APIs, authentication, or CMS backends.
- **Developer Productivity**: Hot reloading, file-based routing, and API routes speed up development.

### **React**
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Encourages reusability and maintainability.
- **Large Ecosystem**: Rich library support for UI components, state management, and testing.
- **Community Support**: Ensures long-term viability and access to solutions.

### **Tailwind CSS**
- **Rapid Styling**: Utility-first classes allow for quick UI building without writing large CSS files.
- **Responsive by Default**: Built-in breakpoints make mobile-first design straightforward.
- **Consistency**: Enforces a unified design system without extra overhead.
